# Time spent is a WORTHLESS Metric

This morning, while walking on the treadmill, I asked myself a question as I stared at the screen in front of me: _What metric should I focus on_? Should I spend 45 minutes walking, or aim for 5,000 steps?

At first, it seemed logical to prioritize time—walking for 45 minutes or even an hour felt like a solid measure of accomplishment. But then I had another thought: I could set the treadmill speed to 1 or 2, stroll for 45 minutes, and still pat myself on the back for "doing a great job."

Guess what? That would be a worthless workout, and here’s why.

When you step on a treadmill, what’s your ultimate goal? For me, it’s to lose weight. Now, if I spend 45 minutes walking, does that guarantee progress toward my goal? Not necessarily. Time spent doesn’t directly correlate to achieving my goal. However, every step I take moves me closer to it, because it’s an actionable, measurable effort.

Taking 5,000 steps also removes room for shortcuts. Whether I set the speed to 2 or 6 is irrelevant—5,000 steps is 5,000 steps. On my next workout, I can increase my goal to 6,000 steps, which means I’ll naturally spend more time on the treadmill and get closer to achieving my goal. On the other hand, if I focus only on time, I could manipulate speed, reduce my effort, and undermine my progress, leaving myself without a reliable metric for growth.

## Applying This to Work

Now let’s translate this into the workplace. Here’s the same question: working 8 hours a day versus hitting specific metrics—what should you focus on?

If you’ve worked in any organization, you’ve probably noticed this scenario: Someone spends 8 hours "working," but within that time, they spend an hour chatting on the phone, another hour on coffee breaks, perhaps take a power nap, and only dedicate 4 hours to actual productive work. At the end of the day, they haven’t made meaningful progress toward team goals.

This is why time should be treated as an allocation slot, not a measure of work accomplished. Promotions shouldn’t be based solely on how long someone has been with the company—whether that’s 2 years or 10. Time spent is a worthless metric if it doesn’t reflect personal growth, team contributions, or the company’s progress.

Returning to the 8-hour workday: Instead of focusing on time spent, set clear daily goals. You might achieve those goals in 5 hours or 10 hours, and either scenario is fine. The point isn’t how long you worked—it’s about hitting the goal and making measurable progress.

## When Time Can Be Useful

To be clear, time slots have their place. They can help you allocate time for specific tasks and maintain balance by ensuring you don’t over-commit. That’s valuable. But don’t confuse time spent with progress made.

**In summary**: Use time as a tool to organize your day, but measure success by tangible outcomes.

Cheers.
